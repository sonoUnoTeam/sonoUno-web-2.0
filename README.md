## How to run the project locally

### Linux

First we need to have Django installed, if not we will use the following command:

```$ python -m pip install Django```

After the installation we look for where the project is

```$ cd yourdirectory/project```
```$ cd yourdirectory/project/sonounoweb```

We activate the manage.py file to run the server

```$ python3 manage.py runserver```

### Windows

We need to have Django installed and we do it as follows:

We go to the place where the project folder is located and from there we execute the command through the console:

```cd yourdirectory/project```
```pip install Django==5.0.2```

Once installed we initialize django

```python\scripts\activate```
```cd sonounoweb```

Finally we run the project

```python manage.py runserver```

### Enter to the website

The server will run at the address http://localhost:8000/sonif1D/inicio
If everything works correctly, we will receive the following message:

```
